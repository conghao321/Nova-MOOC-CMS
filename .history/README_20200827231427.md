# Nova

![dIQ0IJ.png](dIQ0IJ.png)



This is a comprehensive project of a CMS(content-management-system) of MOOC website. 

To be handy, the courses' datasource, I retrieve it from xuechengzaixian.



Overall, Nova is a B2B2C business model. 

First B is representative of the application-provider: us/you.

Second B is representative of the courses' tutors.

Finally, C is the clients, which means learners.

## Background

### Name's source

Nova is the name of the 'wild woman' in the movie <Planet of the Apes>. I really like this movie, in this movie, the position of human and apes are exchanged. For apes, human are ignorance; however, after the protagonist come into this planet, he start to enlighten the human on that planet, including one woman, nova.



Besides, nova is also the group's name, which I attend during my master degree in USC. I make friends with many kind guys here, and I really enjoy the life in USC.



### Why Mooc ?

This is long story, in short, I used many Mooc website, for example, coursera, udemy, udacity and xuechengonline in China. I learned a lot from them, so for long time, I desired to build a comprehensive MOOC website myself. Here it comes.



### What is CMS

CMS is the abbreviation of content management system, so what is content management system? 

Basically, it is a system to manage content... Yeah, just like the name. But the question for that project is: 

**What the content includes? **

The answer is simple: ALL you need to display in a MOOC website.

## Tech-stack

### Architecture

The project has been selected based on Microservice Architecture.



### Skeleton Framework:

The project based on **Spring-Boot** and **Spring Cloud**. 

Combining of them can ideally build a microservice project.



### Programming Langugage:



The back-end services is based on SpringBoot, so the primary language is JAVA.

However, to render some static html, we also use Freemarker.



### Where is Front-end?

The front-end is also a huge project and it depends on which popular framework you like.

I simply scratch it from xuechengzaixian's version, which is built by Vue.js.



Honestly, I don't like vue.js, so in future, I will rebuild it again by React.

**I am a big fan of React.**

## Usage

#### Download it and import it by IntelliJ IDEA.

### Maven and dependency-management

This project's modules are all dependency-managed by MAVEN.

So, check each modules(service) maven file. (pom.xml);

To obey the MVC development rules, we build 5 modules at first.

Common: It includes some classes needed by all other services.

Model: It includes data's model.

Parent: It is the parent module of all other modules, the purpose is to simplify our dependency-management process.
